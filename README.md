# pythonProjects

This is one of my Sumer Of Making projects, in which I use a Udemy course to learn to code python. Every file I make will be available here!
If you're wondering about the file organization system, I am using [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) Udemy course, and every lesson will have its own folder, and every folder will contain any and all python files I made throughout the course.
